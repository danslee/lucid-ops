Still getting gestated within [GitHub][github] and will use [GitHub Pages][github-pages] and will start out based on Jekyll since I believe in simplicity. Go to the [about](/about) page to see what Lucid Operations is all about.

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyllâ€™s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].
